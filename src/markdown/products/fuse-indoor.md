Ready to play right out of the box, the all-new ONIX Fuse Pickleball create a consistency between indoor and outdoor game.  These all-new pickleballs are specifically designed and optimized for pickleball, providing the truest flight and most authentic bounce available. The Fuse balls have exceptional seam welding offering greater durability and resists splitting. The superior balanced ball is strategically aligned with precision-drilled holes.  The indoor ball provides a larger hole pattern and less bounce off of indoor courts, such as concrete surfaces or gymnasium floors.  The balls meet USAPA requirements for outdoor tournament pickleball play.
